My profile includes a collection of configurations and tools I use in my daily workflow. Everything's always a work-in-progress.

My Digital Workspace & Dotfiles
  ---

  Here's a peek into my personal configs for my daily drivers:


   * OS: NixOS [personal nixos repository](https://github.com/jacobeulogio/nixos)
   * Window Manager: Hyprland in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/jacobeulogio/dotfiles)
   * Editor: Neovim [nvim-dotfiles](https://github.com/jacobeulogio/nvim-dotfiles)


  I've also written custom scripts to seamlessly integrate Tmux and Hyprland, creating a smoother workflow. Especially for when using dual monitors. 
  You can explore all of these configurations in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/jacobeulogio/dotfiles)
